# Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation

## 1.1	DATA DESCRIPTION
> The dataset, provided by the Faculty of Education department, consists of 33 columns and 1535 rows. It presents a various set of student attributes, covering personal information like educational background, lifestyle choices, and academic performance. The data includes details such as age, gender, high school type, scholarship status, employment, family structure, parental education, and transportation means. Additionally, the dataset captures studentsâ€™ study habits like weekly study hours, reading frequency, seminar attendance, and methods of exam preparation. Students' classroom engagement, including notetaking, participation in discussions, and self-evaluation of project impact also detailed in the dataset. It also comprises academic metrics such as cumulative grade point averages from the past semester and expected graduation scores, along with specific course IDs, and corresponding grades ranging from fail to outstanding performance. The attributes we are going to use are time spent on preparation for the midterm exam, taking notes in classes, listening in classes, and attendance to classes, as well as how they affected the cumulative grade point averages.


## 1.2	ASSUMPTIONS
> 1.	We assumed that the dataset is representative of the population studied.
> 2.	Each data is assumed to be independent of one another.
> 3.	It is assumed that the grading system of CGPA is standardized.
> 4.	The information about students remains stationary throughout to prevent potential misanalysis. 


## 1.3	OBJECTIVES
### Variable Selected
| Variable Type | Variable Name |
| --- | --- |
| Independent Variables | PREP_EXAM, NOTES, LISTENS, ATTEND |
| Dependent Variables | CUML_GPA |

### Research Question:
> What are the factors influencing the cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of students in the graduation?


### Hypothesis:
> Students who invest significant time in exam preparation, consistently take notes during classes, actively listen during classes and maintain a regular attendance to classes will likely achieve a higher CGPA.


### Objectives:
> 1.	To investigate the correlation between the time spent on preparation for midterm exam and the CGPA.
> 2.	To investigate the correlation between taking notes in classes the CGPA.
> 3.	To investigate the correlation between listening in classes and the CGPA.
> 4.	To investigate the correlation between attendance to classes and the CGPA.
